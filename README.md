# Introduction

To rapidly build online games, developers often have to use a game server engine like SmartFoxServer or Photon, but unfortunately, they come with really high price, especially when more and more users are engaging in our products. Therefore, we develop `game-box engine` powered by the [EzyFox Ecosystem](https://github.com/youngmonkeys/ezyfox-server) aiming to make everything free and open for everyone who are keen on building scalable multi-players games.

EzyFox Ecosystem supports a wide range of most important components to develop an enterprise product including TCP, UDP, WebSocket protocols with SSL encryption, HTTP RESTful API, Remote procedure call RPC protocol, Database interaction, Memory caching, Message Queue.

# Help us by donation

Currently, our operating budget is fully from on our own salaries, and all product developments are still based on voluntary contributions from a few members of the organization. Apparently, the low budget would cause many considerable difficulties for us. Therefore, with a clear roadmap and an ambitious goal to provide intellectual products for the community, we really appreciate your support if you can provide a donation to take us further steps. Thanks in advance for your meaningful contributions!
